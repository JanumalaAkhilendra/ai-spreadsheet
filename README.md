**Features**

* **Data analysis:** The application can provide users with a variety of data analysis features, such as:
    * **Summary statistics:** The application can provide users with summary statistics for the data in the spreadsheet, such as the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
    * **Data visualization:** The application can provide users with data visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to help them understand the data.
    * **Data trends:** The application can identify data trends, such as linear trends, exponential trends, and seasonal trends.
* **Formula generation:** The application can generate formulas for users, based on the data in the spreadsheet. For example, if the user has a column of numbers in their spreadsheet, the application can generate a formula to calculate the average of the numbers.
* **Natural language processing:** The application can understand and respond to natural language queries about the data in the spreadsheet. For example, the user can ask the application "What is the average salary?" and the application will respond with the average salary of the data in the spreadsheet.
* **Collaboration:** The application allows multiple users to collaborate on the same spreadsheet in real time. This makes it easy for teams to work together on projects, even if they are not in the same location.
